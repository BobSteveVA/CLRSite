			<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
			<h3>Diane L. Dressler, Senior Associate, Community Life Resources</h3>
			<p class="abouttext">
Ms. Dressler has 17 years of experience in expanding affordable, accessible housing resources for people with disabilities.  In addition, she has over 35 years of experience in supporting people with disabilities who use State and Medicaid funded services as a case manager, behavioral health specialist, quality assurance manager, statewide training coordinator and statewide housing specialist for the Maryland Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA).  

Since 2001, Ms. Dressler has been actively engaged in statewide efforts to create housing opportunities for people with disabilities, including the Olmstead Housing Task Force, Governorâ€™s Commission on Housing Affordability Special Needs Subcommittee, Maryland Association of Housing and Redevelopment Agencies (MAHRA) Disability Advisory Committee, MDOD Statewide Housing Task Force, HUD Section 811 Program Steering Committee and the Maryland Partnership for Affordable Housing (MPAH).   She was instrumental in developing and implementing the Bridge Subsidy Demonstration Program and the DDA Bridge Subsidy Program; and was successful in obtaining and utilizing Housing Choice Vouchers for people transitioning from Rosewood Center following the announcement that the center was closing.  
During her 3-year tenure with the Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities (MCDD) at Kennedy Krieger Institute, Ms. Dressler was the facilitator and staff support to the MPAH.  This committee acquired a Real Choice Systems Change grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to create the infrastructure necessary to apply for the new HUD Section 811 Project Rental Assistance Demonstration Program.  Maryland was awarded $10.9 million funding for this program in FY 2012, and an additional $10 million in funding through its FY 2013 funding application. </p>
